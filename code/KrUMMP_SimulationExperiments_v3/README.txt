% Main .m files
%----------------
(1) "SuccessiveMatrixPencilMethod.m" : This is the main file for running the algorithm KrUMMP for unmixing. The output is stored in a .mat file saved 
in the "results" folder. 

(2) "plotting.m": This is the main file for generating the scatter plots using the .mat file generated by "SuccessiveMatrixPencilMethod.m" as input. The plots 
is stored in a subfolder within the "results" folder.

% Auxiliary .m files
%---------------------
(3) "MPestim.m": This file implements the Modified Matrix Pencil (MMP) algorithm of Moitra and returns the 
estimated source locations and amplitudes.

(4) "FouryComp.m": This file returns the noiseless Fourier samples (for the l'th level) at the specified locations.

(5) "FouryCompSingle.m": This file computes the sum of the estimated Fouriers samples of the past levels (from 1 to l-1) at the specified locations.

(6) "MatchLocations.m": This file computes a matching between the estimated locations of the sources with their original locations.
